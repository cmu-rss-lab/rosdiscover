# rosdiscover


## Installation

See below for two different methods of installing rosdiscover.
In general, the native installation should be preferred, but for some cases
(e.g., machines that run Mac OS or Windows), the Docker-based method is
ideal.

Both methods require that Docker is installed on your machine and that your
user belongs to the `docker` group (i.e., `sudo` isn't required to run `docker`
commands).
For instructions on installing Docker, refer to: https://docs.docker.com/install/


### Native Installation

The ideal way to install `rosdiscover` is to install to a virtual environment
running on your host machine. This method requires that your host machine is
running Python 3.6 or greater.

We strongly recommend that you install `rosdiscover` inside a Python virtual
environment (via virtualenv or pipenv) to avoid interfering with the rest of
your system (i.e., to avoid Pythonâ€™s equivalent of DLL hell). 
To install roswire from source within a virtual environment using `pipenv`:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ChrisTimperley/rosdiscover rosdiscover
$ cd rosdiscover
$ pipenv shell
(rosdiscover) $ pip install -e .
```

### (Alternative) Docker Installation

In some cases, it may not be possible to install `rosdiscover` natively on
your machine (e.g., Mac OS or Windows machines). `rosdiscover` can be
installed on such systems by building (or downloading) and using a Docker
image for `rosdiscover`.

To build the Docker image for `rosdiscover`:

```
$ docker build -t rosdiscover .
```

Alternatively, to download a prebuilt Docker image for `rosdiscover` from DockerHub:

```
$ docker pull christimperley/rosdiscover
$ docker tag christimperley/rosdiscover rosdiscover
```

To run `rosdiscover` commands via Docker, replace `rosdiscover` with the following
prefix:

```
$ docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -it rosdiscover
```

where `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` is used to mount the
host's Docker socket inside the `rosdiscover` container. Optionally, you may
also want to use volume mounting to persist (and reuse) the cache:

**TODO: requires careful handling of users/permissions.**


## Getting Started

To simulate the effects of a particular launch command using a given XML launch
file for a ROS application provided by a given Docker image (e.g., `example_ros_app`),
run the following:

```
$ rosdiscover launch example_ros_app
    /ros_ws/src/turtlebot_simulator/turtlebot_stage/launch/turtlebot_in_stage.launch
```

To simulate the outcome of a `rostopic` call:

```
$ rosdiscover rostopic example_ros_app
    /ros_ws/src/turtlebot_simulator/turtlebot_stage/launch/turtlebot_in_stage.launch
```
